    "Ans= A database is a structured collection of data organized and stored in a way that facilitates efficient retrieval, updating, and management of data. Databases are commonly used in software applications to store and manage large volumes of structured or unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two types of database management systems (DBMS) that differ in their data models, query languages, and scalability characteristics. Here's a brief differentiation between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Data Model: SQL databases are based on the relational data model, where data is organized into tables with rows and columns. Relationships between tables are established using keys (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys).\n",
    "2) Schema: SQL databases typically have a predefined schema that defines the structure of tables, including data types, constraints, and relationships.\n",
    "3) Query Language: SQL databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) as the standard query language for querying and manipulating data. SQL provides powerful capabilities for querying, filtering, aggregating, and updating data.\n",
    "4) Transactions: SQL databases support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, which ensure that database operations are executed reliably and consistently.\n",
    "5) Scalability: SQL databases are generally vertically scalable, meaning they can handle increased workload by adding more resources (e.g., CPU, memory) to a single server. They may have limitations in horizontal scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Data Model: NoSQL databases support various data models, including document-based, key-value, column-family, and graph-based models. These models are optimized for specific types of data and use cases.\n",
    "2) Schema: NoSQL databases are schema-less or have a flexible schema, allowing for dynamic schema changes and the storage of heterogeneous data within the same collection.\n",
    "3) Query Language: NoSQL databases use query languages specific to their data model. These languages may be less expressive than SQL but are optimized for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.\n",
    "4) Transactions: NoSQL databases may have relaxed transactional guarantees compared to SQL databases. They may support eventual consistency or provide tunable consistency levels based on application requirements.\n",
    "5) Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, allowing them to distribute data across multiple nodes and handle large volumes of traffic and data. They are well-suited for scaling out in distributed environments."

    "3) WHERE: The WHERE clause filters the rows returned by the query based on specified conditions. It restricts the rows that are included in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) GROUP BY: If a GROUP BY clause is present in the query, rows with the same values in specified columns are grouped together. Aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT) can be applied to each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) HAVING: The HAVING clause filters the groups produced by the GROUP BY clause based on specified conditions. It is similar to the WHERE clause but operates on grouped rows rather than individual rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) SELECT: The SELECT clause specifies the columns to be included in the result set. It retrieves data from the tables or expressions generated by previous clauses in the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) DISTINCT: If the DISTINCT keyword is used, duplicate rows in the result set are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause sorts the rows in the result set based on specified columns and sort orders. It determines the order in which the rows are presented in the final output.\n",
    "\n",

    "Some common functions you can use to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame are:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. read_csv(): This is one of the most crucial pandas methods in Python. read_csv() function helps read a comma-separated values (csv) file into a Pandas DataFrame. All you need to do is mention the path of the file you want it to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. head(): head(n) is used to return the first n rows of a dataset. By default, df.head() will return the first 5 rows of the DataFrame. If you want more/less number of rows, you can specify n as an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. groupby(): groupby() is used to group a Pandas DataFrame by 1 or more columns, and perform some mathematical operation on it. groupby() can be used to summarize data in a simple manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. fillna(): Typically in a large dataset, you will find several entries labelled NaN by Python. NaN stands for “not a number”, and represents entries that were not populated in the original data source. While populating the values in the DataFrame, Pandas makes sure that these entries can be identified separately by the user.\n",
    "fillna() helps to replace all NaN values in a DataFrame or Series by imputing these missing values with more appropriate values.\n",

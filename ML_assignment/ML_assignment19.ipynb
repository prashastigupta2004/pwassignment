    "Ans= To preprocess the data for building a recommendation system for a food delivery service, we can utilize Min-Max scaling on certain features such as price, rating, and delivery time. Here's an explanation of how Min-Max scaling can be applied to each feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "Price: The price feature represents the cost of food items. We want to scale the prices to a range between 0 and 1. To achieve this, we first determine the minimum and maximum prices in the dataset. Let's say the minimum price is $5 and the maximum price is $30. We can then apply Min-Max scaling using the following formula:\n",
    "scaled_price = (price - min_price) / (max_price - min_price)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "scaled_price = ($15 - $5) / ($30 - $5) = 0.3333\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the scaled price for the food item would be 0.3333.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rating: The rating feature represents the customer ratings for food items, typically on a scale of 1 to 5. Similarly, we want to scale the ratings between 0 and 1. Suppose the minimum rating is 2.5 and the maximum rating is 4.8. The Min-Max scaling formula for ratings would be:\n",
    "scaled_rating = (rating - min_rating) / (max_rating - min_rating)\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if a food item has a rating of 3.7, the scaled rating would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "scaled_rating = (3.7 - 2.5) / (4.8 - 2.5) = 0.4857\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the scaled rating for the food item would be approximately 0.4857.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delivery Time: The delivery time feature represents the estimated time it takes to deliver an order. We again want to scale the delivery time between 0 and 1. Let's say the minimum delivery time is 20 minutes and the maximum delivery time is 60 minutes. Applying Min-Max scaling, the formula for delivery time would be:\n",
    "scaled_delivery_time = (delivery_time - min_delivery_time) / (max_delivery_time - min_delivery_time)\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if the estimated delivery time is 35 minutes, the scaled delivery time would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "scaled_delivery_time = (35 - 20) / (60 - 20) = 0.625\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the scaled delivery time for the food item would be 0.625.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying Min-Max scaling to the price, rating, and delivery time features, we transform them to a common range of 0 to 1. This preprocessing step ensures that these features are on a similar scale, preventing one feature from dominating the others during the recommendation system's calculations and improving the accuracy of the recommendations."

    "Ans= The main difference between a t-test and a z-test lies in the assumptions about the population standard deviation. Here's a breakdown of the differences and an example scenario for each type of test:\n",
    "\n",
    "t-Test:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Assumption: The t-test assumes that the population standard deviation is unknown and must be estimated from the sample.\n",
    "2) Sample Size: The t-test is appropriate for small sample sizes (typically less than 30) or when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "3) Distribution: The t-test uses the t-distribution to calculate critical values and p-values.\n",
    "4) Variance: The t-test accounts for the additional uncertainty introduced by estimating the population standard deviation based on the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Scenario: Suppose you want to compare the average test scores of two groups of students. You have two independent samples, each with less than 30 students, and you do not know the population standard deviation. In this case, you would use a t-test to assess whether the means of the two groups are statistically different.\n",
    "\n",
    "z-Test:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Assumption: The z-test assumes that the population standard deviation is known or that the sample size is large enough for the sample standard deviation to be a good estimate of the population standard deviation.\n",
    "2) Sample Size: The z-test is appropriate for large sample sizes (typically greater than 30) or when the population standard deviation is known.\n",
    "3) Distribution: The z-test uses the standard normal distribution (z-distribution) to calculate critical values and p-values.\n",
    "4) Variance: The z-test does not account for the additional uncertainty of estimating the population standard deviation since it assumes it is known or approximated accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Scenario: Suppose you want to assess whether a new drug has an impact on blood pressure. You conduct a clinical trial with a large sample of 500 participants, and the population standard deviation for blood pressure is known. In this case, you would use a z-test to compare the mean blood pressure before and after administering the drug."

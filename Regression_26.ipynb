    "Ans= The main assumptions of linear regression are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables should be linear. This means that the change in the dependent variable should be proportional to the change in the independent variable(s). You can check this assumption by creating scatter plots between each independent variable and the dependent variable. If the points follow a roughly straight-line pattern, the linearity assumption is more likely to hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Independence: The observations in the dataset should be independent of each other. There should be no autocorrelation between the residuals (the differences between the actual and predicted values). Autocorrelation indicates that the residuals at one point in time are related to the residuals at another point in time. To check for independence, you can plot the residuals against the order of observations or against time. If there is no apparent pattern or trend in the residual plot, the assumption is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity: Homoscedasticity means that the variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. In simpler terms, the spread of the residuals should be consistent throughout the range of predicted values. You can use a scatter plot of the residuals against the predicted values to check for homoscedasticity. If the points in the plot are randomly scattered and have a constant spread, the assumption is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Normality: The residuals should follow a normal distribution, which means they should be approximately normally distributed with a mean of zero. You can check this assumption by creating a histogram or a Q-Q plot of the residuals. If the points in the Q-Q plot closely follow the diagonal line, it indicates that the residuals are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. No multicollinearity: In multiple linear regression, the independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other. Multicollinearity can cause issues in the model, making it challenging to identify the individual effects of each predictor. You can calculate the correlation matrix between the independent variables to detect multicollinearity. If the correlation coefficients are very close to +1 or -1, there might be multicollinearity present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, you can perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Plot scatter plots between each independent variable and the dependent variable to assess linearity.\n",
    "2) Plot the residuals against the order of observations or time to examine independence.\n",
    "3) Create a scatter plot of the residuals against the predicted values to check for homoscedasticity.\n",
    "4) Generate a histogram or Q-Q plot of the residuals to evaluate normality.\n",

    "\n",
    "Interpretations:\n",
    "1. Intercept (\\(b = 50\\)): In this context, the intercept of 50 doesn't have a practical interpretation because it implies that a house with a size of 0 square feet has a price of $50, which is unrealistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Slope (\\(m = 100\\)): The slope of 100 indicates that, on average, for every one-unit increase in house size (in square feet), the predicted house price increases by $100.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- If a house is 1,000 square feet in size, the predicted price would be \\(y = 100 \\times 1000 + 50 = 100,050\\) dollars.\n",
    "- If a house is 1,200 square feet in size, the predicted price would be \\(y = 100 \\times 1200 + 50 = 120,050\\) dollars.\n",

    "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost (or loss) function of a machine learning model. The cost function quantifies the difference between the predicted output and the actual output for a given set of input data. The goal of gradient descent is to find the set of model parameters (weights and biases) that minimizes this cost function and makes the model as accurate as possible.\n",

    "The name \"gradient descent\" comes from the way the algorithm operates. It starts with some initial random values for the model parameters and then iteratively updates these parameters by moving in the direction of the steepest decrease in the cost function. The \"gradient\" refers to the partial derivatives of the cost function with respect to each model parameter. By taking the negative gradient (opposite direction of the steepest increase) and adjusting the parameters proportionally, the algorithm \"descends\" towards the minimum of the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Gradient Descent is Used in Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is a fundamental optimization technique used in various machine learning algorithms, especially those that involve finding optimal weights for models. Here's how it is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Training a Model: In supervised learning, during the training phase, the model tries to learn the best set of parameters (weights and biases) that minimize the cost function. The cost function measures how well the model's predictions match the actual targets. Gradient descent is used to update the parameters iteratively until the cost function is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Backpropagation: In neural networks, which are a type of machine learning model, gradient descent is used in combination with backpropagation. Backpropagation is an algorithm that efficiently calculates the gradients of the cost function with respect to the model's parameters. These gradients are then used to update the parameters through gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Hyperparameter Tuning: Gradient descent is also involved in hyperparameter tuning, where the goal is to find the optimal hyperparameters that control the behavior of the optimization process itself. For example, learning rate, batch size, and the number of iterations are hyperparameters that influence gradient descent during training."

    "Multicollinearity is a phenomenon that occurs in multiple linear regression when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other. It means that there is a strong linear relationship between the predictors, which can lead to problems in the regression model. Multicollinearity can make it challenging to determine the individual contributions of each independent variable to the dependent variable, and it can lead to unstable estimates of the model coefficients. This, in turn, affects the interpretation and reliability of the regression results.\n",

    "Disadvantages of Polynomial Regression compared to Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Overfitting: As the degree of the polynomial increases, the model can become more sensitive to noise and fluctuations in the data. High-degree polynomials can result in overfitting, where the model fits the training data too closely, leading to poor generalization to new, unseen data.\n",

    "3) Data Exploration: Polynomial regression can be useful during exploratory data analysis to visualize and understand the nature of the relationship between variables. It can help identify patterns and trends that might not be apparent in a linear model.\n",

    "4) Interpolation within Observed Data Range: If the goal is to predict values within the range of the observed data, polynomial regression can provide accurate predictions, especially with low-degree polynomials."

    "Ans= In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, Python raises an exception object that represents the error condition. Exception handling allows you to gracefully deal with these errors by catching and handling exceptions, preventing the program from crashing.\n",

If it's still not handled at that point, the Python interpreter prints a traceback and the program terminates abruptly. This can result in the program crashing and potentially leaving resources in an inconsistent state."

    "- Enhanced Readability: Custom exceptions provide meaningful names that describe the specific error conditions encountered in your code, making it easier to understand and debug.\n",

    "- Modularization: By defining custom exceptions, you can modularize error handling and separate it from the core logic of your application. This improves code maintainability and allows for more organized and structured error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Granular Error Handling: Custom exceptions allow you to handle different error conditions separately, providing more granular control over error handling and recovery strategies.\n",

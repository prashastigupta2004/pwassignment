    "Ordinal Encoding: In Ordinal Encoding, each unique category is assigned a unique integer value based on its order or rank.It is typically used when there is an inherent order or hierarchy among the categories.\n",

    "Ans= Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables by taking into account the target variable or the outcome variable of a machine learning problem. It assigns ordinal labels to categories based on their relationship with the target variable's mean or median value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Calculate the mean or median of the target variable for each category in the categorical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Order the categories based on their mean or median values. Assign the category with the highest mean or median value the highest ordinal label, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Replace the original categorical values with the assigned ordinal labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are working on a project to predict customer churn in a subscription-based service. One of the features is \"Payment Method,\" which can take categories such as \"Credit Card,\" \"PayPal,\" \"Bank Transfer,\" and \"Direct Debit.\" You want to encode this categorical variable into numerical form using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Calculate the mean or median churn rate for each payment method category:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Credit Card\" -> Mean churn rate: 0.25\n",
    "\n",
    "\"PayPal\" -> Mean churn rate: 0.12\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Bank Transfer\" -> Mean churn rate: 0.35\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Direct Debit\" -> Mean churn rate: 0.18\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Order the categories based on their mean churn rates:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Bank Transfer\" (highest mean churn rate) -> Ordinal label: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Credit Card\" -> Ordinal label: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Direct Debit\" -> Ordinal label: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "\"PayPal\" (lowest mean churn rate) -> Ordinal label: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace the original categorical values with the assigned ordinal labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding, the \"Payment Method\" feature would be encoded as: \"Credit Card\" (2), \"PayPal\" (4), \"Bank Transfer\" (1), and \"Direct Debit\" (3)."

Binary Encoding, on the other hand, creates binary codes where each category is represented by a binary sequence (e.g., 0-00 for Male and 0-01 for Female).\n",

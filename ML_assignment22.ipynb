    "Ans= To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores, you would need a dataset with pairs of observations for both variables. Let's assume you have such a dataset.\n",

    "Here are the steps to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Compute the mean (average) of the studying time variable, denoted as \"X̄,\" and the mean of the exam scores variable, denoted as \"Ȳ.\"\n",

    "5) Square each difference obtained in step 2 [(X - X̄)^2].\n",
    "6) Square each difference obtained in step 3 [(Y - Ȳ)^2].\n",
    "7) Sum up all the values obtained in steps 4, 5, and 6.\n",
    "8) Divide the sum from step 7 by (n - 1), where \"n\" is the number of observations in the dataset. This step gives you the sample covariance.\n",
    "9) Calculate the square root of the sample covariance from step 8. This gives you the standard deviation of studying time (Sx) multiplied by the standard deviation of exam scores (Sy).\n",
    "10) Divide the sample covariance from step 8 by the product of the standard deviations calculated in step 9. This will give you the Pearson correlation coefficient (r).\n",

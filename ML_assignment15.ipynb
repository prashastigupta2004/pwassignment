    "Supervised learning algorithms:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Neural networks: Primarily leveraged for deep learning algorithms, neural networks process training data by mimicking the interconnectivity of the human brain through layers of nodes. Each node is made up of inputs, weights, a bias (or threshold), and an output. \n",
    "If that output value exceeds a given threshold, it “fires” or activates the node, passing data to the next layer in the network. Neural networks learn this mapping function through supervised learning, adjusting based on the loss function through the process of gradient descent.\n",
    "When the cost function is at or near zero, we can be confident in the model’s accuracy to yield the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive bayes: Naive Bayes is classification approach that adopts the principle of class conditional independence from the Bayes Theorem. This means that the presence of one feature does not impact the presence of another in the probability of a given outcome, and each predictor has an equal effect on that result. \n",
    "There are three types of Naïve Bayes classifiers: Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Bernoulli Naïve Bayes, and Gaussian Naïve Bayes. This technique is primarily used in text classification, spam identification, and recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression: Linear regression is used to identify the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables and is typically leveraged to make predictions about future outcomes. When there is only one independent variable and one dependent variable, it is known as simple linear regression. \n",
    "As the number of independent variables increases, it is referred to as multiple linear regression. For each type of linear regression, it seeks to plot a line of best fit, which is calculated through the method of least squares. However, unlike other regression models, this line is straight when plotted on a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression: While linear regression is leveraged when dependent variables are continuous, logistic regression is selected when the dependent variable is categorical, meaning they have binary outputs, such as \"true\" and \"false\" or \"yes\" and \"no.\" While both regression models seek to understand relationships between data inputs,\n",
    "logistic regression is mainly used to solve binary classification problems, such as spam identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vector machines (SVM): A support vector machine is a popular supervised learning model developed by Vladimir Vapnik, used for both data classification and regression. That said, it is typically leveraged for classification problems, constructing a hyperplane where the distance between two classes of data points is at its maximum.\n",
    "This hyperplane is known as the decision boundary, separating the classes of data points (e.g., oranges vs. apples) on either side of the plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-nearest neighbor: K-nearest neighbor, also known as the KNN algorithm, is a non-parametric algorithm that classifies data points based on their proximity and association to other available data. This algorithm assumes that similar data points can be found near each other. As a result, it seeks to calculate the distance between data points, usually through Euclidean distance, and then it assigns a category based on the most frequent category or average.\n",
    "Its ease of use and low calculation time make it a preferred algorithm by data scientists, but as the test dataset grows, the processing time lengthens, making it less appealing for classification tasks. KNN is typically used for recommendation engines and image recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest: Random forest is another flexible supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression purposes. The \"forest\" references a collection of uncorrelated decision trees, which are then merged together to reduce variance and create more accurate data predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means: K-means is an algorithm for exclusive clustering, also known as partitioning or segmentation. It puts the data points into the predefined number of clusters known as K. Basically, K in the K-means algorithm is the input since you tell the algorithm the number of clusters you want to identify in your data.\n",
    "Each data item then gets assigned to the nearest cluster center, called centroids (black dots in the picture).The latter act as data accumulation areas.The procedure of clustering may be repeated several times until the clusters are well-defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fuzzy K-means: Fuzzy K-means is an extension of the K-means algorithm used to perform overlapping clustering. Unlike the K-means algorithm, fuzzy K-means implies that data points can belong to more than one cluster with a certain level of closeness towards each.The closeness is measured by the distance from a data point to the centroid of the cluster. So, sometimes there may be an overlap between different clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs): Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) is an algorithm used in probabilistic clustering. Since the mean or variance is unknown, the models assume that there is a certain number of Gaussian distributions, each representing a separate cluster. \n",
    "The algorithm is basically utilized to decide which cluster a particular data point belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apriori algorithms: Apriori algorithms have been popularized through market basket analyses, leading to different recommendation engines for music platforms and online retailers. They are used within transactional datasets to identify frequent itemsets, or collections of items, to identify the likelihood of consuming a product given the consumption of another product.\n",
    "For example, if I play Black Sabbath’s radio on Spotify, starting with their song “Orchid”, one of the other songs on this channel will likely be a Led Zeppelin song, such as “Over the Hills and Far Away.”  This is based on my prior listening habits as well as the ones of others. Apriori algorithms use a hash tree to count itemsets, navigating through the dataset in a breadth-first manner."
